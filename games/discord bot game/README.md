An attempt at a simple multiplayer game using a Discord bot. Players can choose from different races and classes, move around the world map, fight random enemies, and fight other players if they're at the same location. Fights are card-based, while also taking into account the distance between the player and opponent. Fighting other players should work, but might be buggy.
