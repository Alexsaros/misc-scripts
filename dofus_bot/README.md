A bot which automatically farms resourced in the game Dofus, using image recognition and simulated mouse inputs. Allows specifying a route the bot will walk to collect resources. Supports visually recognizing (most) resource locations, but also allows manual inputting the positions of resources on the map, and saving this data. Attempted to automatically handle fights and sell resources on the market when inventory is full. Does not work perfectly.
