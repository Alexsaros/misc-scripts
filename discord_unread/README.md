Uses a JSON generated with DiscordChatExporter to find Discord messages which might not have been responded to in a chat, using the selected criteria (e.g. no other message within an hour, not mentioned in a response, no reaction added, not whitelisted). Allows viewing messages, expanding them, and opening them in Discord.
